## General information

This is an AI that was trained on images of defect printed circuit boards to carry out defect detection and recognition. It can recognize six types of defects on printed circuit boards: missing hole, mouse bite, open circuit, short, spur, and spurious copper.

## Dataset

The Open Lab on Human Robot Interaction of Peking University has released the PCB defect dataset.

R. Ding, L. Dai, G. Li and H. Liu, "TDD-net: a tiny defect detection network for printed circuit boards," in CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 110-116, 6 2019, doi: 10.1049/trit.2019.0019.

## How does it work

Technologies used:

- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics): Object detection model to detect and recognize defects

The YOLOv8 Model was fine-tuned using the ANPR dataset to detect defects.
